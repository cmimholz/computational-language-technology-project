    "## Data Collection and Cleaning\n",
    "Before analyzing the data, we first **load, inspect, and clean** the datasets:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Load datasets**: We import the **Cleantech Media Dataset** and the **Cleantech Google Patent Dataset** into Pandas DataFrames.  \n",
    "- **Remove duplicates**: Identical or near-identical entries are removed to prevent data bias.  \n",
    "- **Handle missing values**: We check for null or incomplete entries and decide whether to impute, replace, or remove them.  \n",
    "- **Filter relevant information**: Non-informative texts (e.g., generic statements) are removed to ensure high-quality analysis.  "

    "To ensure that the text data is **ready for NLP tasks**, we preprocess it using common natural language processing (NLP) techniques:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tokenization**: Split text into individual words or subwords for better analysis.  \n",
    "- **Stopword Removal**: Common but uninformative words (e.g., \"the\", \"is\", \"and\") are removed.  \n",
    "- **Stemming & Lemmatization**: Words are reduced to their root form (e.g., \"developing\" â†’ \"develop\").  \n",
    "- **Lowercasing**: Standardize all text to lowercase to avoid duplicate entries.  \n",
    "\n",
