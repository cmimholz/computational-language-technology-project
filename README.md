# Computational Language Technology Project: Text Mining & Knowledge Extraction  
This project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to accelerate innovation in the **Cleantech sector**. By applying **text mining and knowledge extraction** to media articles and patents, we aim to uncover **trends, technological gaps, and innovation opportunities**.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals  
- **Exploratory Text Analysis**: Identify trends, key players, and technologies in media and patent datasets.  
- **Advanced NLP Techniques**: Develop specialized **embedding models** for Cleantech content.  
- **Intelligent Information Retrieval**: Implement a **RAG-based question-answering system** to enhance knowledge extraction.  

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- **data/**: Cleantech Media & Patent Data Sets
- **notebooks/**:   Jupyter notebooks with code & analyses
- **models/**: Trained NLP models
- **src/**:  Implementation of the RAG system


## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
    > git clone <https://github.com/cmimholz/computational-language-technology-project.git>
2. Explore the repository structure to find the resources you need.
3. If you plan to contribute to this repository, please follow the guidelines outlined in the section Collaboration.

## Collaboration
To ensure a smooth collaboration, please follow these guidelines when making contributions:
1. **Code Style and Standards**: Maintain a consistent code style by following our coding conventions. Use clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes. Please follow the [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) (Python Enhancement Proposals) conventions.
2. **Commit Message Guidelines**: Write informative and concise commit messages. Start with a short summary in the present tense, followed by a more detailed description if necessary. This helps to maintain a clean and organized commit history.
3. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation to reflect your changes. This includes code comments, README files, or any other supporting documentation. Provide clear instructions on how to use new features or any changes to existing functionality.
4. **Code of Conduct**: We expect all contributors to adhere to our project's code of conduct. Be respectful and considerate in all interactions within the project community. Harassment or any form of offensive behavior will not be tolerated.
